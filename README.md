User-Friendly Interface with Java Swing: The front-end is built using Java Swing, providing a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface.

Robust MySQL Database: All hostel data is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring reliable and efficient data management.

JDBC Connectivity: The application uses JDBC to seamlessly connect the Java front-end with the MySQL back-end database.

Developed in NetBeans IDE: The project is coded and tested in NetBeans, which offers an integrated environment for programming, debugging, and running the application.

Introduction

The Hostel Management System is built to simplify record-keeping and administrative tasks for hostel authorities. It minimizes manual work and allows easy access to student records, room assignments, and other essential information. Administrators can verify student eligibility, assign rooms, and manage fees efficiently through a computerized system. By automating these processes, the system improves operational efficiency, accuracy, and saves valuable time.

Project Modules

The application is divided into nine main components:

Connection Provider – Establishes database connectivity.

Login – User authentication and access control.

Home – Dashboard for navigating all functionalities.

Manage Room – Room allocation and status management.

New Student – Add new student records.

Update/Delete Students – Modify or remove existing student information.

Student Fee – Track and manage student payments.

Active Students – View students currently residing in the hostel.

Left Students – Track students who have vacated the hostel.

Database Design

The system uses MySQL to store hostel information in three main tables:

Room Table – Contains room details like number, capacity, and availability.

Student Table – Stores student information including ID, name, contact, and assigned room.

Fees Table – Maintains records of student payments, including fee amount and payment status.
